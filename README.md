# Berlin Event Calendar

Visit
**https://berlin-event-calendar.vercel.app**

## Purpose
[The official Berlin event page](https://www.berlin.de/en/events/) is not easy to see what is happening and when.

This calendar provides easy access to the official Berlin events.

## Events data
All events are scrapped from the official website on the first day of each month by [the sibling repository](https://github.com/songhui-ryu/berlin-event-scraper).

NOTE: events that have no date specified are not displayed in the calendar.
